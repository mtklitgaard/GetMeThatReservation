# WebsiteChecker
Created a simple node application that will make requests to a website and search for specific content and/or response codes. Simple.

It will email you when the criteria matches, using send grid. 

Put in your send grid credentials, plugin your urls and spin this baby up as an azure web job. Azure does all the heavy lifting using webjobs
to schedule when this node app runs.
